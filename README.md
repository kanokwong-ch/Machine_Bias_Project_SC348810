This dataset is tabular data with 14 features. The dataset contains 615 cases from patients that can classify which patients are disease or not.

| VARIABLE  |  DESCRIPTION  | DATA TYPE | EXAMPLE |
|:----------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Patient ID| Index ID to patient identification | NUMBER | 1 |
| Category  | Category of diagnosis (0=Blood Donor, 0s=suspect Blood Donor, 1=Hepatitis, 2=Fibrosis, 3=Cirrhosis) | STRING | 0=Blood Donor |
| Age       | Number of age | NUMBER | 32 |
| Sex       | Sex (f = Female, m = Male) | STRING | m |
| ALB       | An albumin blood test checks your liver and kidney function. Albumin is protein in your blood plasma. Normal Range: 3.5 - 5.5 (grams(g)/deciliter(dL) | NUMBER | 38.5 |
| ALP       | Alkaline phosphatase test measures the amount of ALP in your blood.To check your liver or bone abnormalities.Normal Range: 44 - 147 (international units(IU)/liter(L) | NUMBER | 52.5 |
| ALT       | Alanine transaminase is an enzyme found mostly in the liver. An ALT test measures the amount of ALT in the blood. High levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of a liver injury or disease.Normal Range: 7 - 56 (units(U)/liter(L) | NUMBER | 7.7 |
| AST       | Aspartate aminotransferase is an enzyme found mostly in the liver.but it's also in muscles and other organs in your body. An AST test measures the amount of AST in the blood.The test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease. Normal Range: Men 14 - 20 (units(U)/liter(L)), Women 10 - 36 (units(U)/liter(L)| NUMBER | 22.1 |
| BIL       |Bilirubin test measures the levels of bilirubin in your blood.Higher than usual levels of bilirubin may indicate different types of liver or bile duct problems. Sometimes, higher bilirubin levels may be caused by an increased rate of destruction of red blood cells.Normal Range: 0.1 - 1.2 (miligram(mg)/deciliter(dL) | NUMBER | 7.5 |
| CHE       | Cholinesterase is a blood test that looks at levels of 2 substances that help the nervous system work properly. They are called Acetylcholinesterase is found in nerve tissue and red blood cells. Pseudocholinesterase is found primarily in the liver.The test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.Normal Range: 8 - 18 (units(U)/milliliter(mL)) | NUMBER | 6.93 |
| CHOL      | Cholesterol (or lipid profile) blood test looks at the levels of cholesterol and other fats in your blood.The test is assess your risk of heart disease and stroke. Normal Range: <= 200 (milligrams(mg)/deciliter(dL)) | NUMBER | 3.23 |
| CREA      | Creatinine test is a measure of how well your kidneys are performing their job of filtering waste from your blood. Normal Range: 0.7 - 1.3 (milligrams(mg)/deciliter(dL)) | NUMBER | 106 |
| GGT       | Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test measures the amount of GGT in the blood. GGT is an enzyme found throughout the body, but it is mostly found in the liver.High levels of GGT in the blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts.Normal Range: 5 - 40 (units(U)/liter(L)) | NUMBER | 12.1 |
| PROT      | Total protein test measures your albumin and globulin levels. High levels may mean you have inflammation or infection. Low levels may suggest kidney problems, malnutrition, and several other possible conditions. Normal Range: 6 - 8.3 (gram(g)/deciliter(dL)) | NUMBER | 69 |
